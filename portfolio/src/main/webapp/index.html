      <h1>Hello There!</h1>
        <p>Thank you for checking this page out. My name is Cedric, and I'm happy to introduce more about myself!</p>
      <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
      <h3>Academics</h3>
        <p>
         I have just ended my second year of studies at SMU, Information Systems.
         I graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic with a Business Diploma and ventured into this field of studies 
         as I have been intruiged by technology since a young age. It ended up being an excellent decision as 
         I enjoy exploring commonly used technologies and applying it in an academic and exploratory setting.
        </p>

                    I am currently participating in Google's invitation-only Software Product Sprint program, where I get 
                    to learn more about software engineering best practices, work on projects (both personal and in a group) 
                    and we get to practice our technical interviewing skills too, all activities are done under the guidance 
                    of helpful Google engineers as our mentors!

                  <b>Singtel - Business Analyst Intern: </b>
                    I am currently doing an internship at Singtel as a Business Analyst, where my main responsibilities 
                    are to gather requirements and set up data pipelines with an automated push from different data
                    sources. 
              </li>
           </ul>
        </p>

      <h3>Co-Curricular Activities</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
              <li>
                <b>SMU - Data Associate in Business Intelligence & Analytics Club: </b>
                    Over the course of 4 months, we learned about various data science topics through peer teaching. I
                    taught about the topic of regression to 50 other associates. Also, I worked in a team of 4 to create
                    a script which automates the booking of facilities in SMU and provides different analytics of booking
                    usage.
              </li>
              <p> </p>
              <li>
                <b>SMU - Project Ketnoi 3: </b>
                    This was an Overseas Community Service Project and I was the head of the fundraising team. We managed
                    to raise S$6,000 through our fundraising event. The funds were used to purchase second-hand laptops
                    for students in a secondary school in Hue, Vietnam. The team then flew over to teach the students
                    basic programming knowledge and it was a very enriching experience as we saw their progress throughout
                    the curriculum we developed for them! 
              </li>
