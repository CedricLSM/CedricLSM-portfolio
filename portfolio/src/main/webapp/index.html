      <h1>Hello There!</h1>
      <p>Thank you for checking this page out. My name is Cedric, and I'm happy to introduce more about myself!</p>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Academics</h3>
      <p>
         I have just ended my second year of studies at SMU, Information Systems.
         I graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic with a Business Diploma and ventured into this field of studies 
         as I have been intruiged by technology since a young age. It ended up being an excellent decision as 
         I enjoy exploring commonly used technologies and applying it in an academic and exploratory setting.
